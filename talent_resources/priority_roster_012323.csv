"Lynsey","Addario","Explorer & Photographer","United States","Photographer","","","","","Lynsey Addario is a photojournalist based in London, where she works for National Geographic, the New York Times, the New York Times Magazine, Fortune, and other publications. She was born on November 13, 1973, in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Addario graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1995 with a B.A. degree in international relations. With no professional photography training, she began photographing in 1996 for the Buenos Aires Herald in Argentina, where she worked for one year before returning to her home base in New York. In 1997, she began freelancing for the Associated Press, where she was a regular contributor for three years. While in New York, she completed several overseas projects, including traveling to Havana to work on a series of photo essays about the influence of capitalism on young Cubans. She returned to Cuba the following year for Pope John Paul II's visit and every year thereafter until 2002, documenting life under one of the last communist regimes.

In January 2000, she moved to New Delhi, where she was based for eight months, covering India, Afghanistan under Taliban rule, Pakistan, and Nepal for the Associated Press, the Boston Globe, and the Houston Chronicle. In April 2001, Addario moved to Mexico City, where she worked primarily for the New York Times while continuing to photograph a steady stream of international features outside the country. After the events of September 11, 2001, she returned to South Asia, where she covered the war in Afghanistan and the resulting women's education issues there.

Addario moved to Istanbul to cover the Middle East in January 2003. The following month, she traveled to northern and central Iraq, where she spent almost seven months covering the war for several magazines. She continued her Iraq coverage for the New York Times until early 2005 while simultaneously covering the ongoing conflict in Darfur. Since 2004, she has traveled to the troubled area several times, maneuvering around the Sudanese refugee camps in Chad and through burned-out, abandoned villages in Darfur, where she documented internally displaced people and rebel groups. In 2004, she also extended her coverage of the Middle East to women's issues in Saudi Arabia, while shooting other features in Turkey, Libya, South Africa, and Lebanon.

She recently completed a series on infant mortality, juvenile justice, sexual assault of minors, malnutrition, and education in countries across Africa for the New York Times.

Addario has won a number of awards, including a 1999 Award of Excellence from Pictures of the Year. In March 2002, Photo District News magazine named her one of the 30 best emerging photographers in the world. That year, the International Center of Photography presented her with the Infinity Award as Young Photographer of the Year.
Her photo essays and single images from Iraq, Mexico, and Pakistan have been featured in the American Photo Annual ""Best Of"" editions in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Her work earned her a coveted place in a World Press Master Class in Amsterdam. And in 2005, she was honored as a Fuji Young Photographer in Perpignan, France. Addario is also a recipient of the Soros Foundation Grant.","","","https://www.instagram.com/lynseyaddario/","https://www.lynseyaddario.com",""

Brands with attention to the environment","Sony Ambassador","A wise person once said that a man without a landscape is completely unarmed. 
I clearly remember my first travel within the Amazon Forest: the excitement of discovering a new land. That?s where the amazing power of our planet resides. 

Over the years, travelling and taking photographs have become one thing.
What made me love this job was the encounter with ?the other?: other places, other human beings, other stories. The privilege of witnessing and the honour of telling them. It is a powerful human experience. It has taught me that if you want to be a better photographer, first of all you have to be a better person.

I have studied to become a photojournalist, and my cultural and visual education comes from there. But photography does not amount to an objective recording of facts. Every shot is a subjective point of view about the world. It is documentation but also creation.
Photography is an ever-changing language. This is the reason why I feel engaged in continuous research. 

In recent years, I have been working on a project focusing on the fragile and constantly evolving balance between human being and the environment. This relationship sums up every relevant challenge ahead of us, every story that deserves to be told. 
We are changing the balance of our planet. And our whole future depends on this outcome.

In the end, our work as photographers is not only about discovery or wonder. Those are simply means to reach an end. We need to constantly remember ourselves that we don?t just live on this planet. We are part of it. 
No matter how small our action, each time we defend Nature, we save ourselves.

He received his BA from Harvard College where he created his own curriculum integrating courses in ecology, medical anthropology and development studies. He then received two graduate degrees from UC Berkeley: an MPH in Epidemiology with a focus in Nutrition, and a PhD in Environmental Science, Policy and Management focusing his studies in wildlife ecology and ecosystem services.

Since 1999, Dr. Golden has been conducting environmental and public health research in Madagascar where he created a local research organization called MAHERY (Madagascar Health and Environmental Research). In the local language, ?mahery? means strength and this organization has been the sole research organization operating in Madagascar?s largest remaining tract of rainforest. This group supports 20 field staff and he has trained nearly 25 Malagasy university students in field research methods.

Following his PhD, Dr. Golden began a post-doctoral fellowship at the Harvard University Center for the Environment where he led a study investigating the role of terrestrial wildlife consumption in protecting food security and human nutrition. Since then, he became a Research Scientist in the Dept. of Environmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health and was the former Director of HEAL (Health & Ecosystems: Analysis of Linkages)- a multi-institution consortium dedicated to producing empirical linkages between environmental change and human health. Over the past four years, he has served as PI or lead investigator on several research efforts: 1) the investigation of terrestrial wildlife declines in Madagascar on food security and human nutrition; 2) the investigation of marine fishery collapses in Madagascar (and across the globe) on food security and human nutrition; and 3) intervention analyses to determine solutions to wildlife harvest unsustainability and local health crises.

Over the past few years, Dr. Golden has received several honors. In 2014, he was named one of 14 National Geographic Emerging Explorers, an award that recognizes ?uniquely gifted and inspiring young adventurers and scientists?explorers who are already making a difference early in their careers.? He is one of 12 members on the CBD/WHO joint task force who was asked to synthesize connections between biodiversity and human health. And, he is one of 40 members of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services?

"Joya","Griffin","","","Veterinarian","","","","","I am Dr. Joya, a wife, a mother, a veterinarian, a lover of fun, sunshine, fashion and sometimes running. There are many things I love, but I have always loved animals. From the age of 7 after adopting our first cat Chessie, I knew I wanted to be a veterinarian. I wanted to care for the creatures that could not care for themselves. I would take in neighborhood strays, raise tadpoles and watch my cats deliver their kittens within our home. Becoming a veterinarian seemed a natural fit for me, however, it was never just about the animals.  I wanted to help people like me who deeply cared for their pets get the best care they could.

Veterinary dermatology has been one of my greatest joys. I chose to pursue it very early on in veterinary school after seeing how the talented doctors at Cornell took my beloved family dog Gizmo and changed her life. She was hairless, stinky with ulcerations on her face. She lived in an e-collar because of how severe her skin was. Within weeks, they were able to clear up her infections and get her itching under control. Her skin healed, her hair regrew, and she came out of an e-collar! I saw firsthand the difference quality specialized care could make, how it saved her life, and I wanted to do that for others. Not only to make their pets look beautiful again, but to give them their quality of life back, restoring the human-animal bond.","","","https://www.instagram.com/drjoya_thepetskinvet","https://www.drjoyadvm.com/",""

As a photographer Huey has created over 30 stories for the National Geographic magazines including several cover stories.  Most recently a cover story on Public Lands.  Here is a video that Nat Geo calls  ?Aaron Huey?s Most Epic Photos.?

As a Stanford Knight Fellow and then as one of the first d.School Media Experiments Fellows, Huey focused on using the human centered design process in both the analog and digital world to evolve his storytelling.  That resulted in many projects beyond traditional photography, including the evolution of his art and advocacy non-profit Amplifier,  where he created the global art phenomenon called ""We The People"" with his collaborators Shepard Fairey and a small team now based in South Seattle.   

We the People broke crowdfunding records, and along with its followup We the Future, and Huey?s Sherpa Photo Fund project, he has raised over 2 million dollars between his last 3 crowdfunding projects. 

Huey?s Bear Ears Virtual Museum VR experience, built with partner Devlin Gandy, won the 2019 Webby for best VR Interactive Design and (thanks to a new Nat Geo Explorer Grant) parts of that project will become Pre-Colonial History and Cultural Heritage lessons in AR and VR for K-12 classrooms across the US. 

Huey recently art directed the RESET Capitalism campaign for Imperative 21 and a group of 72,000 businesses worth a collective 15 Trillion dollars in assets that is attempting to literally redesign Capitalism and also art directing a Covid emergency response campaign that brought in over 10,500 works from around the world.   He is is currently working on a set of new AR experiments, and the Campaign for Nature with National Geographic and the Wyss Foundation.

Perhaps most importantly Huey was named the 3rd coolest Dad in America by Fatherly.com after Lebron James and Kelly Slater!   Huey lives in Seattle with his wife Kristin, his son Hawkeye (age 10), and his daughter Juno (age 5).

On a chance birdwatching tour, he became fascinated by birds and began to study biology. Not long after, a praying mantis appeared before him on a starry night at his childhood home, and he was captivated. Insects have since become his passion, and he recently created Projeto Mantis, a program that aims to show people how amazing and interesting the micro-world of insects can be. He treasures our shared natural world, especially the Atlantic Rainforest, and feels freedom and delight when he is in the field.

Leo Lanna is a Brazilian scientist guided by the search for praying mantises in tropical rainforest nights. He combines poetry, wildlife photography and innovative research methods to produce vanguard science, studying aspects of evolution, species richness and natural behavior beyond data. Through his independent organization, Projeto Mantis, he?s been leading expeditions in Amazonia and the Atlantic Rainforest for six years, advocating for the wonders of the mysterious diversity found under the cover of darkness. With a flashlight and a camera, he unveils an astonishing and endangered universe - vibrant, alien, poetic and fragile, eternal and ephemeral. Since then, he hasn?t spent more than a handful of days without a praying mantis home. Unlike most scientists researching insects, he developed with Projeto Mantis a protocol to care for every single mantis collected for research, until its natural death. Leo believes that biological sciences are not only about data, but about the intrinsic connection scientists develop to the living beings they research. While documenting new species and novel behavior, Leo keeps pushing the boundaries of research out in the wild, with hundreds of hours of forest night dives on some of the most endangered ecosystems of our planet.","Writing poetry; playing videogames; listening to music in LP records (specially Brazilian music)","I run my own independent non-profit organization, Projeto Mantis.

Recently, Radcliffe began experimenting with interpretative photography, preferring to allow the abstract content within the frame to dictate the voice and purpose of the image. His Elements series focuses on the bold, austere, graphic and emotionally raw imagery, that is trapped behind a diffused lens. With painterly abilities, Radcliffe uses this diffused methodology to subtly awake the subconscious and expose the isolated figure or vision painted within a rhetorical frame.","","","Https://@ruddyroye","http://ruddyroye.com/",""

Nichole was born in the state of New York and graduated from Tufts University with a degree in political science. She began her career in Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria, focusing on regional issues related to identity, conflict, and human rights. From 2012-2015 Nichole led Agence France-Presse?s East Africa video bureau before immersing herself in documentary photography. She is also a contributor to Everyday Africa, a collection of images shot on mobile phones across the continent, and an attempt to showcase the moments missing from dramatic news images ? everyday life that is neither idealized nor debased.

Nichole aims to create photographs and films that demand consideration for the lives of those represented ? their joys, challenges, and ultimately their humanity. Amidst our fractured present existence, she believes that a well-told story can cut through the noise, deepen empathy, and inspire a more conscious world. 

The primary focus of Nichole?s work is on humanity?s fraught, intimate, and ultimately unbreakable connection to the natural world. In 2016 Nichole began her body of work entitled Where Our Land Was, supported by The GroundTruth Project, which investigates the human consequences of significant environmental change in Somalia. She is currently exploring the vital role the Congo Basin plays in the ecological balance of our planet as a National Geographic Explorer. As climate change advances, sustained photography must illuminate the complex and multifaceted problems underway, evoke the power and beauty of the world we share, and remind us all of our collective responsibility to fix what we have broken.

In 2015 Nichole was a Rory Peck Awards News Finalist for her coverage of the Westgate mall attacks in Kenya. In 2018 she was awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights prize in new media for her images documenting Europe's response to the African migration crisis. Her work has been recognized by Pictures of the Year, the Leica Oskar Barnack Award (LOBA, the One World Media Awards, the Alexandra Boulat Award for Photojournalism, The Magenta Foundation, and The Jacob Burns Film Center, among others.

Nichole?s photography has been exhibited at The United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture in San Francisco, Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris, Photoville in Brooklyn, The Nikola Rukaj Gallery in Toronto, and beyond.
